Employee Details are stored in a file in the following format:

EmpID;EmpName;Salary

Write a shell script to find the count of employees whose salary is less than the average salary of all employees.

The file with the employee details will be given as a command line argument when your script will run.

For example,

If the input file contains the following employee records

EmpID;EmpName;Salary
100;A;30000
102;B;45000
103;C;15000
104;D;40000
 

The output will be,

2
